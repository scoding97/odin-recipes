    <p>This is my <strong>best</strong> ever banana bread recipe. It really is the best I have ever tasted! It's very moist and it freezes well. I also bake this in 3 small loaf pans however you may need to <em>shorten</em> the baking time.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup ripe mashed bananas</li>
        <li>½ cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>⅓ cup buttermilk</li>
        <li>1 ¾ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups white sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ cup chopped pecans (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
